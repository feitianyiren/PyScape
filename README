A simple Python soundscape creation tool
========================================

* Defaults to the included FM3 Buddha Machine loops, but you can change that in the source ("wpath").

* WAV files need to be mono (or panning will not work). Convert stereo files with stereo2mono.sh.

* Inspired by http://www.interactivesoundscapes.org/software.html

Requires the OpenAL and FreeALUT libraries to be installed.
