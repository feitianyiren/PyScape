A simple Python soundscape creation tool
========================================

Install from within the PyScape directory with

  pip install --user .

or

  sudo pip install .

Run as:

  pyscape [filename.pyscape]

* Defaults to the included FM3 Buddha Machine loops, but you can change that either from the GUI (click "Load sounds" and select a directory with WAV files) or in the source ("wpath").

* WAV files should ideally be mono. (You can convert stereo files with stereo2mono.sh, which uses sox.)

* Stereo files will also play in PyScape but will not be affected by panning.

* This program is somewhat inspired by Interactive Soundscape Designer (http://www.interactivesoundscapes.org/software.html) and Boodler (http://boodler.org/).

PyScape requires the OpenAL and FreeALUT libraries. If the Python Imaging Library is also present, pretty background images are displayed.
