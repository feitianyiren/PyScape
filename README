A simple Python soundscape creation tool
========================================

* Defaults to the Boodler (http://boodler.org/) Buddha machine loops, but you can change that in the source ("wpath").

* WAV files need to be mono (or panning will not work). Convert them with stereo2mono.sh. (The BM loops are also stereo, so you need to convert them first.)

* Inspired by http://www.interactivesoundscapes.org/software.html

* No edit functionality yet

Requires the openal and alut libraries to be installed.
